# StoutLabs' Gatsby.js Configs Theme

Opinionated barebones GatsbyJS configuration theme. This installs and configures most of my preferred plugins/tools, similar to my starter but as a theme.

Note: This is mostly just for my own learning purposes. Feel free to poke around. (I think I'd prefer to use my starter when cranking out a new site.)

Features/Includes:

- Global 'normalizing' via `styled-components-normalize`
- SASS compilation, so you can use your own CSS files if you want. (Use the `/src/styles` directory)
- `styled-components`
- `react-icons`
- `gatsby-plugin-sharp`
- `gatsby-transformer-sharp`
- `gatsby-image`
- `react-helmet`
- `formik` (with `yup` validation) for forms
- `gatsby-plugin-sitemap`
- `gatsby-plugin-robots-txt`
