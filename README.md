# StoutLabs' Gatsby.js Starter

Opinionated barebones GatsbyJS starter, pre-installed with my preferred tools and structure.

Almost zero styling, almost zero layout - ready to edit, delete what you don't need!

## Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying this starter.

    ```sh
    gatsby new [DIRECTORY NAME] https://github.com/stoutlabs/gatsby-starter-stoutlabs
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd [DIRECTORY NAME]/
    yarn develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

## Learning Gatsby

Looking for more instructions?

- Full documentation for Gatsby can be found [on their website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) - and they are **FANTASTIC** docs!! ðŸ’œ
- Shameless plug: I'll be writing more articles soon over at [Alligator.io](https://alligator.io/), primarily in their Gatsby section... but perhaps in other areas as well. (And it's truly a great site, if you've never visited!)
